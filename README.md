# **Krishna Koushik Mandava — Portfolio ⚡️**

### *A clean, modern portfolio built with Flutter showcasing my projects and experience.*

Welcome to the source code of my personal developer portfolio — a minimal, responsive, and elegant Flutter web app designed to highlight my **skills**, **projects**, and **achievements**.
You can freely explore, fork, and customize this for your own use.

## 🧠 **About the Project**

Building and maintaining a personal portfolio from scratch can be time-consuming.
This project provides a Flutter-based, ready-to-deploy portfolio template — built with scalability and customization in mind.

You can personalize every detail of the site — from your **social media links** to **projects**, **skills**, and **achievements** — by simply editing a JSON file, without touching any Flutter code.

## 🔄 **Making Changes and Redeploying**

To update your portfolio and push changes live on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Update Content or Code**
   Make the necessary changes in your project files.
   For example, to update your portfolio content, edit:

   ```
   /assets/portfolio.json
   ```

2. **Rebuild the Web Version**
   From your project directory, run:

   ```bash
   cd /home/krishna/Desktop/Portfolio
   flutter build web --release
   ```

3. **Redeploy to Vercel**
   After building, deploy the updated site:

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

Your changes will now be live at your Vercel portfolio URL.

If you want, I can **integrate this directly into your personalized README** so it has a full polished structure including setup, customization, and redeployment instructions. Do you want me to do that?
