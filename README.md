# **Krishna Koushik Mandava — Portfolio ⚡️**

### *A clean, modern portfolio built with Flutter showcasing my projects and experience.*

Welcome to the source code of my personal developer portfolio — a minimal, responsive, and elegant Flutter web app designed to highlight my **skills**, **projects**, and **achievements**.
You can freely explore, fork, and customize this for your own use.

## 🧠 **About the Project**

Building and maintaining a personal portfolio from scratch can be time-consuming.
This project provides a Flutter-based, ready-to-deploy portfolio template — built with scalability and customization in mind.

You can personalize every detail of the site — from your **social media links** to **projects**, **skills**, and **achievements** — by simply editing a JSON file, without touching any Flutter code.
